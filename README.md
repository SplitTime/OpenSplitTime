OpenSplitTime
================

OpenSplitTime is a site for endurance athletes, fans and families, race directors, volunteers, support crews, and data geeks. Our purpose is simple: to make it easy to collect endurance event data, play with it, plan with it, safely archive it, and never worry about it again. 

The site is built and maintained by OpenSplitTime Company, a Colorado nonprofit corporation. If you find the website useful, motivating, entertaining, or strangely beautiful, please consider making a small [donation](https://www.opensplittime.org/donations) to help us keep the doors open. OpenSplitTime Company is registered with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization. Your donations are probably tax deductible (but if you have any question you should ask your tax advisor about that stuff).

Our software engine is open source. If you have a suggestion for the site, or you are a software engineer and would like to help with development, or if you are a race director or data geek and would like to be a beta tester, please [contact us](mailto:mark@opensplittime.org) and let's talk.

OpenSplitTime is developed and maintained by endurance athletes for endurance athletes.

Contributing
-------------

We love Issues but we love Pull Requests more! If you want to change something or add something feel free to do so. If you don't have enough time or skills start an issue. Below are some loose guidlines for contributing.

### Pull Requests

Writing code for something is the fastest way to get feedback. It doesn't matter if the code is a work in progress or just a spike of an idea we'd love to see it. Our testing is weak we know. But it's something we value. If adding a new feature please consider adding tests for it. :heart:

### Issues

Be detailed. They only person who knows the bug you are experiencing or feature that you want is you! So please be as detailed as possible. Include labels like `bug` or `enhancement` and you know the saying a picture is worth a thousand words. So if you can grab a screenshot or gif of the behavior even better!
