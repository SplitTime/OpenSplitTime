# This Struct is a lightweight alternative to SplitTime when many objects are needed.
# The time zone parsing methods in Rails are slow and create an unacceptable delay
# when working with many objects, particularly in a full spread view.

# SplitTimeData receives both a non-localized absolute_time_string and a localized
# absolute_time_local_string from the database query.

SplitTimeData = Struct.new(:id, :effort_id, :lap, :split_id, :bitkey, :stopped_here, :pacer, :data_status_numeric,

                           :military_time, keyword_init: true) do

  # The events/spread view relies on this attribute and slows unacceptably
  # when it is parsed into an ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone object.
