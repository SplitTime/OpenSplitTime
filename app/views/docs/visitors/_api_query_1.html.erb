  <h4 class="card-header">Querying the API</h4>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>The OpenSplitTime API follows the JSON API standard, described in detail
      at <%= link_to 'jsonapi.org', 'https://jsonapi.org', target: '_blank' %>. You can query for a collection of
      records using the pluralized model name, and if you have an individual record id, you can query for an individual
      record.</p>
  </div>

<div class="card">
  <h4 class="card-header">Standard Index Queries</h4>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>The models available for index queries are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Organizations</li>
      <li>Courses</li>
      <li>Event Groups</li>
      <li>Events</li>
      <li>People</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Query any of these models by passing a GET request to the applicable endpoint and including your API key as a
      bearer authorization in the request header. For example (you will need to replace <code>your.api.key</code> with
      your own API Key):</p>
    <hr/>
    <code>$ curl -H "Authorization: bearer your.api.key" https://www.opensplittime.org/api/v1/event_groups</code>
    <hr/>
    <p>Records are returned in batches of 25. Links are included in the response header to obtain additional batches.</p>
    <p>Remember that individual records are generally more useful and
      <strong>response times will generally be faster for individual record queries than for index queries</strong>.</p>

  <h4 class="card-header">Index Queries Scoped to a Parent Record</h4>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>In addition to standard index queries, you may query for records scoped to an individual parent record. Currently, this feature is available
      for Raw Times scoped to an event group.</p>
    <p>Query for Raw Times by passing a GET request to the endpoint shown below and including your API key as a
      bearer authorization in the request header:</p>
    <hr/>
    <code>$ curl -H "Authorization: bearer your.api.key" https://www.opensplittime.org/api/v1/event_groups/hardrock-100-2024/raw_times</code>
