  <h4 class="card-header">The Effort Audit Screen</h4>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>You can see the all Split Times and Raw Times for a single Effort in the Effort Audit screen. You can reach this
      screen by clicking the <strong>Audit</strong> tab from any Effort screen or by clicking an Entrant's name from the
      <strong>Raw Times > Splits</strong> screen.</p>
    <p>The Effort Audit screen gives you a full picture of what Raw Times have been submitted for the Entrant's bib
      number and which of those Raw Times have been matched to which Split Times.</p>
    <p>From this screen you can also choose to match or un-match Raw Times and, for multiple matching Raw Times, choose
      which time (if any) should govern the Split Time.</p>

  <h4 class="card-header">Matching and Unmatching Raw Times</h4>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>Sometimes Raw Times are not automatically matched to a Split Time. These unmatched Raw Times will appear in the
      Unmatched Raw Times column. If there is a Split Time available, the Raw Time will have a <strong>link</strong>
      icon allowing you to
      match it. Click the <strong>link</strong> icon and the Raw Time will be matched to the Split Time.</p>
    <p>A Raw Time that is already matched to a Split Time will have an <strong>un-link</strong> icon allowing you to
      un-match it. Click
      the <strong>un-link</strong> icon and the Raw Time will be un-matched from the Split Time.</p>
    <p>For example, assume a runner having <strong>Bib #132</strong> comes through <strong>Aid 2</strong> at
      <strong>10:45</strong>. A volunteer records the time using OST Remote but
      <strong>inadvertently enters the Bib as #123</strong>. The time is synced, and OpenSplitTime evaluates
      it as "good" and automatically creates a Split Time matching that Raw Time entry. </p>
    <p>Now the runner wearing <strong>Bib #123</strong> comes through <strong>Aid 2</strong> and is recorded at
      <strong>10:55</strong>, and this time is also synced. OpenSplitTime evaluates the second time as a duplicate and,
      <strong>because it is too different from the already-matched time</strong>, it does not automatically match the
      newly synced Raw Time.</p>
    <p>A timing volunteer at race headquarters looks at the Effort Audit screen for <strong>Bib #123</strong> and sees a
      <strong>matched Raw Time (10:45)</strong> and an <strong>un-matched Raw Time (10:55)</strong> for this entrant at
      Aid 2. The volunteer determines that the 10:55 time is the correct time.</p>
    <p>The volunteer clicks the <strong>link</strong> icon next to the 10:55 Raw Time.
      <strong>The Raw Time is matched and the Split Time is changed to 10:55.</strong> Next, the volunteer clicks the
      <strong>un-link</strong> icon next to the 10:45 Raw Time.
      <strong>That Raw Time is un-matched from the Split Time.</strong></p>

<div class="card">
  <h4 class="card-header">Changing the Governing Raw Time</h4>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>You may have <strong>multiple Raw Times that you want to keep matched to a single Split Time</strong>. This may
      happen if, for example, you have multiple volunteers at the Finish using OST Remote for redundancy. Whichever of
      the Raw Times was synced first will be used to create the Split Time.</p>
    <p>If the Raw Times are a few seconds apart, <strong>you may decide to leave them both matched</strong> but use the
      other time to govern the Split Time. Click the <strong>equals (=)</strong> icon for the Raw Time you prefer. The
      Split Time will change to match the Raw Time you clicked.</p>
