  <h4 class="card-header">Raw Times Splits</h4>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>You can see all Raw Times for any single station by visiting the Raw Times Splits screen (<strong>Raw Times >
      Splits</strong>). This screen lists each bib number for which Raw Times have been recorded. For each bib number,
      it shows the Split Time (if any) for that bib number at the station, and it shows all Raw Times recorded for that
      bib number at that station.</p>
    <p><strong>For multi-lap Events, multiple Split Times will be shown (one for each lap).</strong></p>
    <p>The rightmost column shows the discrepancy, meaning the largest time interval among the Split Time and all
      related Raw Times. A large discrepancy usually indicates one or more problem Raw Times or a problem Split
      Time.</p>

  <h4 class="card-header">Invalid Bib Numbers</h4>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>The Raw Times Splits view lists all bib numbers for which Raw Times were submitted. This includes bib numbers
      that <strong>should not appear at the particular station</strong> (for example, because a 50K Entrant was recorded
      at a station that only 100K Entrants should visit). This also includes bib numbers that are <strong>entirely
      invalid</strong>, because they were not issued to any Entrant or because they include a wildcard character (*).
    </p>
    <p>Invalid bib numbers often represent typographical errors or transposed numbers. When you are trying to fill holes
      or otherwise solve problems in the final Event results, it is critical to have the full record of bib numbers,
      <strong>both valid and invalid</strong>, recorded at each station.</p>
