  Your donations help us keep the lights on and the servers fed. We are a nonprofit 501(c)(3) corporation, and 100% of your money
  goes to maintaining and improving the site.
</p>
<p>
  We are grateful for any and all donations, even if it's just a few dollars. You can use your credit card or a PayPal account,
  or you can contribute Bitcoin, which gets your donation to us with no fees!
  Our providers will send you a receipt for tax purposes, and you'll get a bit of extra good karma next time you get out on the trails.
