    Creating or importing your first event
  </h4><br/>
  <p>If you are starting from scratch, you've come to the right page. If you are working with an Organization that has
    existing Events, it is probably easier
    to <%= link_to 'duplicate an event group', getting_started_3_path %>
    or <%= link_to 'create it from within the Organization', getting_started_4_path %></p>
  <p> 1. <%= link_to 'Sign up', new_user_registration_path %>.</p>
  <p> 2. Create a <%= link_to 'new Event', event_staging_app_path('new') %>.</p>
  <p> 3. Follow the step-by-step instructions to add splits. You can manually enter information or import a splits CSV
    file.</p>
  <p> 4. Continue to add your entrants' personal information (names, ages, contact info) manually or import a
    CSV file. To avoid duplication, you will need to reconcile Entrants with our participant database. You can always
    add or change entrant information at any time, including after the event is finished.</p>
  <p> 5.a. If this is an upcoming event, use the Live features and OST Remote to track your entrants on the course. Your
    time data will be available to the public instantly as it is submitted to the database.</p>
  <p>or</p>
  <p> 5.b. If this is an event that happened in the past and you have the data somewhere in gmail, or sharing a
    thumb drive in a drawer with the Sword of Many Truths, or scribbled in a notebook in your basement, dust it off and
    enter it using our handy tools.</p>
