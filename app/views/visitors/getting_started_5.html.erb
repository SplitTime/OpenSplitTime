  Once your Splits are in place, it's time to get the Effort and Split Time data in.
</p>
<p><strong>Effort import</strong></p>
<p>
  Remember that you have a header row containing the names of your data. OST can ingest the following personal
  information fields during an Effort import: <strong>first name, last name, gender, age, bib number, wave, city, state,
  country, phone, and email</strong>. OST will do its best to match up columns, and the order of the columns is not
  important.
  OST will ignore columns whose names it can't match to one of these fields.
</p>
<p>
  To the right of your personal information columns you will need to have exactly as many Split columns as you have
  Splits associated with your effort. OST will reject an import if it detects a mismatch.
</p>
<p>
  If this seems confusing, it's pretty simple in execution. <strong>Here is a sample spreadsheet you can download
  for easy reference: <a href="https://github.com/SplitTime/OpenSplitTime/raw/master/hardrock2015.xlsx"
  download="https://github.com/SplitTime/OpenSplitTime/raw/master/hardrock2015.xlsx">Hardrock 2015</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
  Sign in, click around, and play with the various screens and buttons. Add some things manually and import some data. If you get
  hopelessly lost and make a mess, just delete your Event, and all Efforts and Split Times related to the Event will be
  deleted with it. You cannot, accidentally or otherwise, delete any data that you did not create yourself.
