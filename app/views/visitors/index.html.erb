      <h2>Unprecedented Live Tracking Tools</h2>
      <p>OST Live Entry tools are revolutionary. OST learns from your time data. It gives you race progress for each aid
        station. It tells you instantly where your runners last reported, where and when they are due next, and who is
        past due and possibly lost.<br/><br/>
        OST Remote is our free iOS app for recording entrant times at aid stations. It syncs with OpenSplitTime and
        simplifies the task of gathering time data over many aid stations and long periods of time.<br/><br/>
        <strong>Omniscience is pretty cool.</strong></p>

      <h2>Endurance events change people.</h2>
      <p>They create hard challenges in a soft world. They bring us together when our natural inclination might be to
        wander alone. They help us feel the simple joys of food, warmth, and rest by exposing us to cold, hunger and
        discomfort. They help us realize how much more is buried within when we seem empty and dry.</p>
